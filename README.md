# Servers-Practice

This repository contains three distinct server applications: a goal tracking app, a book store, and a blog platform. These applications are built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization, and Bcrypt for authentication. Also, this repository includes a backend cheat sheet that covers Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, and Bcrypt.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into the following main directories:

- `01_goals`: The server for the goal tracking app.
- `02_book_store`: The server for the book store.
- `03_blogs`: The server for the blog platform.

Each directory includes a separate Node.js project with its own `package.json` file.
